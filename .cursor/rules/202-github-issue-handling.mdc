# GitHub Issue & Project Management

## Context
- Applies when creating issues from task documents
- Applies when managing project roadmaps via GitHub CLI
- **Applies when creating Pull Requests (refer to Rule 200 for content requirements)**
- **AI Agent must perform issue management directly using `gh` commands, not shell scripts**

## Rules

### 0. Task Selection & Prioritization
- **Identify Next Task**: When asked to proceed with the next task, the AI Agent must:
  1. Check `gh issue list` and project board for current status.
  2. Filter issues whose **required dependencies** (pre-requisite tasks) are already completed.
  3. Among runnable issues, prioritize the one with the **earliest `Start Date`** relative to the current local time.
- **Dependency Awareness**: If an issue depends on another (e.g., `REQ-FUNC-002` depends on `REQ-FUNC-001`), ensure the pre-condition is fully verified before starting.

### 1. Parallel Execution Logic
- **Code Conflict Detection**: Before starting a task, check if any files it requires are currently being modified by an ongoing/unmerged task.
- **Switch to Parallel Task**: If the highest priority task would cause a code conflict with a task currently in progress, search for the next runnable task that:
  1. Has no code overlap/dependency with the current work-in-progress.
  2. Is also marked as `Must` or `Should` priority.
- **Context Preservation**: Ensure that switching between parallel tasks doesn't lead to stale code assumptions. Always pull latest changes before starting a new parallel branch.

### 2. Issue Creation (Direct CLI)
- **AI Agent performs**: Read task markdown files and create issues using `gh` CLI directly
- Extract title from first line: `# [#NNN] Title`
- Extract body from rest of content: `tail -n +3 file.md`
- Create issue: `gh issue create --title "..." --body "..."`
- **Do NOT** create shell scripts for batch issue creation
- Create issues one by one with proper error handling

**Example:**
```bash
gh issue create \
  --title "[#006] 프로젝트 생성 및 템플릿 목록 API 구현" \
  --body "$(tail -n +3 issue-006-REQ-FUNC-001-BE-001.md)"
```

### 2. Labels Management
- Labels may not exist in repository initially
- Create issues first without labels if they fail
- Add labels later if needed: `gh label create "name" --description "..." --color "..."`
- Labels are optional for issue creation

### 3. Project & Roadmap Integration
- **List projects**: `gh project list --owner <username>`
- **Get field IDs**: `gh project field-list <number> --owner <username>`
- **Use Project V2 Node IDs** for item manipulation (not integer IDs)
- **Required Fields**: `Start Date` and `End Date` (Type: `DATE`)
- **Set dates**: 
  ```bash
  gh project item-edit \
    --id <ItemID> \
    --project-id <ProjectNodeID> \
    --field-id <FieldID> \
    --date YYYY-MM-DD
  ```

### 4. Batch Operations
- **AI Agent performs batch operations** by iterating through multiple `gh` commands
- Use sequential execution with proper error handling
- Add delays (`sleep 2`) between API calls to avoid rate limiting
- Log success/failure for each operation

### 5. Workflow Integration
- Create issue → Add to project → Set schedule dates
- Verify project item IDs after adding issues
- Use `gh project item-list` to get item IDs for date setting

## Examples

<example what="Creating single issue">
# AI Agent directly executes
gh issue create \
  --title "[#006] API Implementation" \
  --body "$(tail -n +3 tasks/issue-006.md)"
</example>

<example what="Setting schedule dates">
# Get project items first
gh project item-list 10 --owner wild-mental --format json | jq -r '.items[] | "\(.id)\t\(.content.number)"'

# Set start and target dates
gh project item-edit \
  --id PVTI_xxx \
  --project-id PVT_kwHOBWaOeM4BJJCo \
  --field-id PVTF_xxx_START \
  --date 2025-11-27

gh project item-edit \
  --id PVTI_xxx \
  --project-id PVT_kwHOBWaOeM4BJJCo \
  --field-id PVTF_xxx_TARGET \
  --date 2025-11-30
</example>

<example what="Batch issue creation by AI Agent">
# AI Agent iterates through issue files
for i in {006..015}; do
  issue_num=$(printf "%03d" $i)
  issue_file="issue-$issue_num-*.md"
  
  if [ -f $issue_file ]; then
    title=$(head -1 "$issue_file" | sed 's/^# //')
    gh issue create --title "$title" --body "$(tail -n +3 $issue_file)"
    sleep 2  # Rate limiting
  fi
done
</example>

<bad-example what="Using shell scripts">
# ❌ Don't create separate .sh files
./create_backend_issues.sh

# ✅ Instead: AI Agent executes gh commands directly
</bad-example>

<bad-example what="Using integer ID for projects">
# ❌ Wrong: Using integer project ID
gh project item-edit --project-id 7 ...

# ✅ Correct: Using Node ID
gh project item-edit --project-id PVT_kwHOBWaOeM4BJJCo ...
</bad-example>

## AI Agent Responsibilities
1. Read task specification files from `tasks/github-issues/`
2. Execute `gh` commands directly for each issue
3. Handle errors and provide feedback
4. Set project schedules based on execution plan
5. Verify successful creation and report status
6. **Never delegate to shell scripts** - perform operations directly
